  ## Robot/FM-staging

This branch combines all of the different subsystems (intake, slide, shoulder, elbow) into one.

Each subsystem has been developed and tested individually, but this branch contains untested code now that all of them are merged together.

This branch serves as a final review branch before merging into the robot/FM branch.
